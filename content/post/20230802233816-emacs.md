## moving to text {#moving-to-text}

| Keybind  | Description                                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `s/S`    | Snipe move to matching text, cycle matches with `, / ;`     |
| `gs SPC` | Avy move to matching text                                   |
| `ys z/Z` | yank sourround with snipe                                   |
| `ys x/X` | yank sourround with snipe; exclude letters from word-object |

These movements can also be used for creating text objects, ie marking with `vs
CHARS` or `vg SPC CHARS`. For yank, `ys` is bound to `evil sourround`, thus the
alternative keybinding of `z/Z` or `x/X`


### evil surround {#evil-surround}

`yse f` insert surround function
`yse t` insert surround tag
`cs'"` change ' with "
`ds'` delete '

`yse b` insert ()
`yse B` insert {}

phonetics:
`y` yank or insert
`d` delete
`c` change

The letters `w`, `W`, and `s` correspond to a |word|, a |WORD|, and
a |sentence|, respectively. These are special in that they have nothing to
delete, and used with |ds| they are a no-op. With |cs|, one could consider them
a slight shortcut for `ysi` (cswb `= =ysiwb`, more or less).

A `p` represents a |paragraph|. This similarly to w, W, and s above; however,
newlines are sometimes added and/or removed.

The target(what comes after eg. **ys**) takes a wim motion or text object. The
difference is that motion, e.g., `cw`, operates from the current cursor
position. A command using a text-object, e.g., `ciw` operates on the whole
object regardless of the cursor position.

There are two text objects(`a` and `i`), for the three building blocks of
plaintext: words, sentences and paragraphs.
`aw` around word
`iw` inner word

`f` forward to char
`F` backward
`t` till before char
`T` backwards untill

Use `,` and `;` to jump to the previous and next occurrence of the character
found with t, T, f, or F.

evil-indent-plus

-   `ii` A block of text with the same or higher indentation.
-   `ik` A block of text with the same or higher indentation, including the first
    line above with less indentation.
-   `ij` A block of text with the same or higher indentation, including the first
    line above and below with less indentation.

See [code](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-surround/blob/master/evil-surround.el#L52-L67) and detailed [examples](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround/blob/master/doc/surround.txt).

## narrowing / multiple cursors {#narrowing-multiple-cursors}

Narrow also works on text objetcs

| Keybind          | Description                                                           |

| `R`              | Select a word, press `R` to select the rest. Useful with narrow first |
| `M d/D`          | Select next/prev candidate of current selection                       |
| `C-n/p`          | Next/previous region                                                  |

## org {#org}

| keybind           | Description                                                       |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `[[*`  C-SPC      | Insert internal link to heading (ie. complete after typing `[[*`) |

| SPC n l / C-c C-l | Copy link id / Insert link id                                     |

### babel {#babel}

`C-c C-v d`, insert org src-blocks. If it is invoked within a code block will split it into two separate code blocks, and if it is invoked outside a code block will surround the current selection with a new code block
`C-c C-,`, insert environment defined in `org-structure-template-alist`
<https://stackoverflow.com/a/54330547>

These are the languages org can evaluate.
[babel laungages](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html) shows 'out-of-the-box' enabled languages.

See currently enabled languages with `C-h v` `org-babel-load-language`


### highlight code blocks {#highlight-code-blocks}

org-mode just appends `-mode` to the language name given and tries to find a major mode function.
Emacs lisp function names are case sensitive.

We can get a list of all such functions by typing `C-h a` `-mode$`, i.e. search
for all functions that end with -mode, but the resulting list contains many
modes that are not major modes for programming languages.

For more complicated mappings, org uses the alias mapping, (key, value), in `org-src-lang-modes`. See them with `C-h v`.

## code completion {#code-completion}

### company {#company}

<https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/develop/modules/completion/company>
the following insert mode keybinds are available to evil users to access
specific company backends:

Keybind	Description
C-x C-]	Complete etags
C-x C-f	Complete file path
C-x C-k	Complete from dictionary/keyword
C-x C-l	Complete full line
C-x C-o	Invoke complete-at-point function
C-x C-n	Complete next symbol at point
C-x C-p	Complete previous symbol at point
C-x C-s	Complete snippet
C-x s	Complete spelling suggestions


### tips {#tips}

`gv` visual restore. Reselect the text
`gc` comment
`ea` insert at the end of the word
While ivy search is active, open wgrep buffer `C-c C-e`. Changes are committed
with `C-c C-c` and aborted with `C-c C-k` (`ZZ` or `ZQ` for evil)
`SPC '` resume last ivy session
`M-o` opens hydra when search is active
`C-w` n: evil-window-map
`"ayy` This will store the line in register a.
`"ap` This will put the contents of register a at the cursor.


### insert mode {#insert-mode}

-   `C-w` evil-delete-backward-word
-   C-k evil-insert-digraph( `C-k aa` inserts å)
-   C-r evil-paste-from-register.
    `"` and `+` is default register(system clipboard), ie `C-r "` is like `p`.
    See the register with `: reg` or `M-SPC i r` or paste using `councel-yank-pop` (`SPC y p`)
    `"+yy` and `"+p` copies to and from the default register.
    `*` is "mouse selection and middle click" register. They are named quoteplus
    and quotestar.
-   C-y evil-copy-from-above. Copy char above
-   C-t evil-shift-right-line. Indent
-   C-d evil-shift-left-line. Remove indent


## projectile {#projectile}

Make projectile discover your projects

`M-x projectile-discover-projects-in-directory` and then give the path to the
dir containing the projects. Fx `~/code`

Now projects can easily be opened with `SPC p p`

`M-x projectile-invalidate-cache` bound to  `SPC p i`


## magit {#magit}

| key       | desc                           |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| backspace | magit-diff-show-or-scroll-down |
| RET       | magit-show-commit              |
|           |                                |


### See diffs for two commits side-by-side {#see-diffs-for-two-commits-side-by-side}

`M-x magit-toggle-buffer-lock`

See the diffs associated with the two commits in two separate magit-revision
buffers. You can accomplish this by loading up the first diff in the usual way
(e.g. by hitting `RET` or `BACKSPACE` on it in a log view), running `M-x
magit-toggle-buffer-lock` so that the buffer becomes pinned to that particular
view, and then loading up the second diff in the usual way.

Using `RET` the old buffer might be switched, but due to the `buffer-lock` it is
still available in the buffer list.


### Compare two commits {#compare-two-commits}

Maybe:
<https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/27967>


## lsp {#lsp}

`lsp-describe-session` will show you the project layout and then `lsp-workspace-folder-add/remove` to create the proper project layout.
Projects are saved in `~/.emacs.d/.local/etc/lsp-session`

## insert unicode characters {#insert-unicode-characters}

`quoted-insert` is bound to `C-q` in normal mode and `C-v` in insert mode.

> The variable `read-quoted-char-radix` specifies the radix for this feature; set
> it to 10 or 16 to use decimal or hex instead of octal.
>
> Unicode chars are often described by their hex-code, thus set
> (setq read-quoted-char-radix 16)

eg, `C-v 21d2 RET` in insert mode will put the ⇒ arrow.
Reverse lookup is done by `SPC i u` or `C-x 8 ret`

(the `C-x 8` could have been chosen to remind us that the default input radix is
8 (octal))

`C-x 8` also has many shortcuts for inserting common characters. In this case,
`C-x 8 o` inserts "°". The `C-x 8` keymap is a good place to define own
shortcuts, to insert the characters you use most often.


#### Change input-method {#change-input-method}

```text
M-x set-input-method TeX
```

Then type something like `\alpha` — it will be replaced with the corresponding
Unicode character. You can switch the input method off by typing `C-\`.

You can find all the supported TeX commands with

```text
M-x describe-input-method
```
