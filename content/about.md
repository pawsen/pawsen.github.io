# Keeping contact is hard!
I make friends easily. They come and go based on life circumstances. Proximity
and interests spark friendships, but proximity and interests change. Best
friends become old distant friends. New friends become best friends. Some people
get married and stop calling. Some people get divorced and re-appear. I still
love them all, whether we talk or not.

I donâ€™t subscribe to that "blood is thicker than water" metaphor. I feel pretty
equally connected to everyone.
