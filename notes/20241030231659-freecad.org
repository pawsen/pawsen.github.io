Notes for making 3D models in freecad. Only interesting for me

#+hugo: more

Freecad is one of the more popular open source CAD programs. I use it for making simple containers, like the [[id:aed7d0e0-3449-4a9c-a67f-f6d76b1a775e][tilt sensor]], some stuff for rope solo [[id:81c7c1b3-33ab-40c9-b195-f86bb234c3df][climbing]].

To get started, I followed a lot of the tutorials on [[https://www.youtube.com/@MangoJellySolutions][MangoJellySolutions youtube channel]].

These are some notes I took while following along.

* Extrude pins to height of Pad - bottom wall thickness

- Container made, ie rounded square, pad. Go to ~Part Design~ -> ~Apply a dress up feature~ -> set a thickness.
- Create a sketch on the bottom inner surface of the container, import the geometry of the rounded corners, create circles at center points for the corners, close the sketch
- Pad the circles, set a ~formula length~ of ~Pad.Length - Thickness.Value~.
* Ensure tangency across mirror plane :ATTACH:

A smooth transition with a mirrored sketch:
- add a horizontal construction line
- make the right-most point and horizontal line tangent

* Using profile templates :ATTACH:
- open ~sketcher~ wb
- create sketch/profile (it does not matter on which plane - the clones will be oriented by changing ~Map Mode~) and rename it on the tree view.
- right click on main tree and click ~create group~. This creates a folder where profiles can be dragged into
- open ~Part Design~ wb and create a body and sketch a ~path~ that the profile will be swept along.
- using a ~subshape binder~ from the wb will not work. A ~binder~ cannot change the ~Map Mode~.
- Instead, open ~Draft~ wb, select the profile and click ~Modification/Clone~ and drag the cloned profile into the ~Body~ in the tree view.
- Set the ~Map Mode~ as desired, probably using a vertex and a line with ~Attachment Mode~ set to ~Normal to edge~.
- Go back to ~Part Design~, Select the cloned profile and click ~Part Design/Create additive feature/additive pipe~. Either ~Add Edge~ and select all the edges the profile should be swept along, or use ~Object~ to select the ~path~ sketch.

* Shape binder VS SubShape binder
- The ~Shape binder~ only allows referencing different geometries of a single object.
- The ~SubShape binder~ allows referencing geometries across objects or files.

  It is useful to use a ~subshape binder~ to bind different sketches together, ex. with a ~Additive Pipe~. ~Additive Pipe~ can only sweep along edges of a single ~Object~. If the path is made up of multiple sketches, select them, create a ~SubShape binder~ and use the binder as path.
* Compound VS Fusion (union) :ATTACH:
- Compound: Objects are still separate, ie. there are no edges between them and overlapping objects are visible inside the others.
- Fusion: One objects, there are edges between shapes and internal faces have been removed

* Make polar array/polar mirror of a shape
** Part WB
- go to ~draft WB / modifications / Array tools / polar array~
This creates a multi body object, which is not allowed in Part Design WB.
** Part Design WB
- Select the body, go to ~Part Design / Create a clone~. Create as many clones as needed, f.x three, and rotate the new Bodies 120Â° each using the ~Placement / angle~ property. Use the three clones to create a new ~body~ using ~Part Design / Boolean operation~.
  All clones references the same original (which is not part of the new ~body~. Make changes to the original and all the clones will have the same changes.)
* Mirroring offset features
** Part Design WB :ATTACH:

If the orientation of the ~datum plane~ is not as desired, try to rotate it along some axis.
#+CAPTION: Create a datumplane between two vortex/points and use this plane for offset mirroring.

* Reorient sketch, PartDesign WB
Duplicate a sketch, ~Edit/duplicate selected object~, and deselect everything except the sketch.

Select the new copy, go to ~Sketch/Reorient sketch~, click ok to ~Sketch with a support face cannot be reoriented. Do you want to detach it from the support~, select the plane it should be oriented on and close the Sketch.
Select the ~reference~ in ~Attachment mode~ and click ~Flip sides~ if needed.

Now we can e.g. ~loft~ between two sketches and edit the sketches if needed.

* Check mesh for error

.. wb "Mesh" --> "Check solid mesh" if the result is "not solid" you can use "Evaluate and repair mesh" to see what problems the mesh has, you can also use "Split components" to see if it is made up of multiple meshes and evaluate what actions to take to fix and solidify it.

...sometimes slicers can compensate for errors but not always, so it is always better if the mesh is error-free in FreeCAD
* Errors
** Failed to compute left/right minimum bearings for "cursor.pcf"

Fix by
#+begin_src sh
sed -i 's/>cursor.pcf</>monospace</g' ~/.config/FreeCAD/user.cfg
#+end_src
