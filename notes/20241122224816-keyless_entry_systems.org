RKE is an uni-directional authentication system. In RKE, besides advanced features that recently
became available (e.g., start, stop, panic), user unlocks or locks the vehicle by pressing the cor-
responding button on the key fob. When a button is pressed, Radio Frequency (RF) signals are
emitted towards the car in the frequency bands of 315 MHz, 433 MHz, or 868 MHz depending on
the geographic location.

One way HF rolling code.

The following is taken from the Locking docs for a 2004 Berlingo:
Use of the remote control necessitates matching with the vehicle.
The coded message sent to the receiver by each remote control is composed of the following codes :
- A fixed code linked to the key
- A rolling code matched with the vehicleâ€™s receiver
- A code corresponding to the action to be performed
- A code corresponding to the condition of charge of the batteries
