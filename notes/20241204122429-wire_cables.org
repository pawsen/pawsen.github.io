#+HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :summary "Notes about steel wire splicing using u-clips and thimble"


Someone asked abbot wire rope splicing in the [[https://www.facebook.com/share/p/afiMKUTgtMw7bt6e/][Rope Test Lab fb group]], specifically how to connect two wires. There are two ways, seen below

The conclusion is that the parallel connection slips at low-ish load, if the clamps are tightened as per the European norm

In US the norm is to use Crosby clips and follow [[https://www.thecrosbygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/56.pdf][their recommendation]]. They use a much higher torque to tightening the clamps.

The OP of the fb-thread made some [[https://walteralswissenschaftler.blogspot.com/2019/09/connecting-parallel-cables-in-ropes.html][tests of slippage for parallel cable connections(10mm cables)]]. The findings are

- do not use parallel connections if yoy you need high loads: like in long zip lines, heavy elements etc. :: Use eyes with thimbles
- use grease on the screws
- re-tighten as many times as necessary (maybe 3-4 times, until the torque does not change any more).
- check for slippage (make a marking, check after the first loads and during inspection).
- Use rather a higher torque than a lower. I recommend in this application =18-20 Nm=.
