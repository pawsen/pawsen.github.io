#+HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :summary "I made a angle-sensor(using an LCD, accelerometer and arduino) to show the angle of a Kilterboard(climbing wall)"

I made a angle-sensor for a Kilterboard(a Kilterboard is a specific type of climbing wall where the angle of the wall can be adjusted, to make the climbing harder or easier).
The file for the arduino and =stl='s for 3d printing the cases, along with a lot of details in the readme, are [[https://github.com/pawsen/tilt-sensor/][on github]].

The sensor and arduino communicates over I2C.
The rise time, the time it takes a line between the devices to go from low(0V) to high(5V), is important for I2C and depends on the length and type of cable(the cables capacitance), pullup-resistors and connections.
For I2C in =Standard Mode= =tf= should be below =1μs= and is found from measurements by attaching an oscilloscope to the =SCL= line and =gnd=.

The Rise time =1.64μs= is higher than the allowed 1μs, but still works well at 100Hz. See the section on [[https://github.com/pawsen/tilt-sensor/?tab=readme-ov-file#resistor-sizing][resistor sizing]] in the readme for more info.
