Software-defined radio (SDR) is a radio communication system where components that conventionally have been implemented in analog hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a computer.

The RTL-SDR is an cheap software defined radio receiver-dongle based on [[https://osmocom.org/projects/rtl-sdr/wiki/Rtl-sdr#Specifications
][DVB-T TV tuners with RTL2832U chips.]]


In essence, an RTL dongle consists of two ICs: the ~RTL2832U~ and a tuner chip, for which various types are used. The ~RTL2832U~ on has two A/D converters, and a USB interface, and lots of digital logic in between. The tuner chip is an analog downconverter, from VHF/UHF to frequencies of a few MHz, which can be handled by the RTL chip's A/D converters.
The ~RTL2832U~ outputs 8-bit I/Q-samples, and the highest theoretically possible sample-rate is 3.2 MS/s, however, the highest sample-rate without lost samples that has been tested wit regular USB controllers so far is 2.4 MS/s

RTL-SDR cannot work as SDR and DVB-T receiver at the same time. Due to the limitations of the chip in SDR mode (bandwidth drops to ~3 MHz, when in DVB-T mode it is equal to 6-8 MHz), you cannot fully decode the DVB-T signal in SDR mode. You need to switch the driver in your OS and use different programs (such as VLC, HDTV Player or SDRSharp and GNU Radio).

** sample rate
- Sample rates between 225001 Hz - 2.4 MHz should be ok.
=rtl_test -s 2.25e5= fails, while =rtl_test -s 2.25001e5= works.

Best Practice, use a sampling rate that is power-of-2.
One of these:
- -s 2.4e6 (2.4 MHz) - general-purpose, wideband
- -s 2.048e6 - default for =rtl_sdr=
- -s 1.024e6 - for lower bandwidth or CPU usage
- -s 256000 - for narrowband use (e.g., 433 MHz sensors)

The rtl2832 does quadrature (IQ) sampling, thus the bandwidth is equal to the sample rate setting (as per its documented command parameters)
Quadrature sampling produces twice as much data (2 8-bit components) per IQ sample,

Data rate is how much IQ data it's listening to/watching, the sample rate is usually the bit rate of audio quality.
#+begin_example
FM radio broadcast's data rate is about 250KHz(how wide it's transmission is: bandwidth).
The sample rate is the rate of audio quality, in broadcast FM it is about 32KHz.
One is data bandwidth, the other is audio output quality.
#+end_example

IQ samples for a 96 kHz wide RTL-SDR needs about 1.5 Mbit/s for the raw stream (namely, 96000 (samples/sec) x 8 (bits/sample) x 2 (I and Q channel).

:END:

~Self-describing~ formats (e.g. WAV, FLAC, MP3) have a header that completely describes the signal and encoding attributes of the audio data that follows.
~raw~ or ~headerless~ formats do not contain this information, so the audio characteristics of these must be described.

- sample rate
  The sample rate in samples per second (`Hertz' or `Hz'). Digital telephony traditionally uses a sample rate of 8000 Hz (8 kHz), though these days, 16 and even 32 kHz are becoming more common. Audio Compact Discs use 44100 Hz (44.1 kHz). Digital Audio Tape and many computer systems use 48 kHz. Professional audio systems of‐ ten use 96 kHz.

- sample size
  The number of bits used to store each sample. Today, 16-bit is commonly used. 8-bit was popular in the early days of computer audio. 24-bit is used in the professional audio arena. Other sizes are also used.

- data encoding
  The  way in which each audio sample is represented (or `encoded').  Some encodings have variants with different byte-orderings or bit-orderings.  Some compress the audio data so that the stored  audio  data  takes  up less  space  (i.e.  disk  space or transmission bandwidth) than the other format parameters and the number of samples would imply.  Commonly-used encoding types include floating-point, μ-law, ADPCM, signed-integer  PCM, MP3, and FLAC.

- channels
  The number of audio channels contained in the file. One (`mono') and two (`stereo') are widely used. Surround sound audio typically contains six or more channels

** Dipole

A dipole antenna consists of two conductive rods or metals of equal lengths separated by an insulator.

#+CAPTION: dipole antenna
[[attachment:Dipole_Antenna_length.jpg]]

The length of a half wave dipole antenna (the most common type), is calculated as

$$ λ = c / f $$
$$ L = λ/2 $$

where  \( c ≈ 0.97% x c_0 \) is the reduced speed of radio waves in a conductor (\(c_0=299.792458E^6\)m/s the speed of light in vacuum) and λ is the wavelength.

The bandwidth of a half length dipole is around 7%, ie  \( 96.5% x c_f < c_f < 103.5% x c_f \), where \( c_f \) is the center frequency.

The [[http://www.csgnetwork.com/antennaedcalc.html][dipole calculater]] is simple to use. To optimize the antenna for a frequency RANGE, do the calculations twice, once for the low end of the range and once for the high end; then average the two and plan to adjust the VSWR on both ends of the range as needed.
Remember that there is about 2cm of metal inside the antenna itself which needs to be added on.

Cheat sheet for various lengths and frequencies

- Large Antenna, 2 Sections, 42cm + 2cm is resonant @ ~162 MHz

My SDR can be tuned from 0 to 30 MHz (or from 25 to 1900 MHz, or whatever). Can I offer all of that tuning range to the users?
#+begin_quote
No. Such an SDR does not feed the entire 0-30 or 25-1900 MHz spectrum to your computer: that would be way too much data. Instead, a small part (at most a few MHz) are filtered out in external hardware, centered around some frequency that you can tune. With the WebSDR software, users can only tune around within that small part of the spectrum. You (as the operator of the site) choose the centerfrequency.

https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/issues/1811#issuecomment-927144555
FWIW, manually specifying a level anywhere from -3 to -9 will pick out the signal in the referenced 1000k sample file.
rtl_433 -r g003_433.83M_1000k.cu8 -Y level=-5

So I think that what I learned in this case, for a PPM analysis of the Acurite 609 signaling, is:

    Load the .ook file into triq.org/pdv to see the pulse trains.  Edit the .ook file to isolate just a few of the OOK pulse trains for the device you're investigating.  Load that edited file into triq.org/pdv, and you now have a timing analysis for just the device you're investigating.
    Look at the pulse train; note any sync bits and gaps between them and at the gap between the sync pulse(s) and the first data pulses; use the timing of that gap between sync pulses and first data pulse as the value for SYNC
    Note the gap between packets as the value for the timing of the GAP field
    Look at the gap/period/timing analysis and look for largest counts of the short and long gaps: those are probably carrying the data.  Use those timings as the values of SHORT and LONG in the analyzer
    Look at the resulting bit pattern at the bottom of the analysis.  It should reflect the number of packets you have from the visual inspection of the pulse train at the top.  BUT, the actual data packets may be 1's complement of the bit pattern reported, as the encoding may have chosen to use SHORT/LONG as 0/1 or 1/0.
