audio vario using Kalman filter to fuse acceleration and pressure sensor data. Bluetooth transmission of LK8EX1 sentences.


** Testing the GPS

- baud rate =9600=
*** u-blox center
u-blox can be tested and configured through their free (windows only) [[https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center][u-blox u-center]] software. Use a USB-to-Serial(UART) converter, like a =PL2303=. Make sure the voltage and logic to the u-blox is =3.3V=.

*** Arduino as a USB
The arduino can bu used as a UART device.

Arduinos have a Serial bridge chip. For old =Duemilanove= it is a =FTDI FT232RL= chip (true serial bridging), for Uno R1 it is =ATmega8U2= and R2/R3 it is =ATmega16U2=. The Unos thus uses a MCU programmed to act as a serial bridge, the firmware is [[https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/tree/master/firmwares/atmegaxxu2][here]].

Upload an empty sketch
#+begin_src c
void setup() {}
void loop() {}
#+end_src
and either remove the micro controller =ATmega328P= or tie =RESET= to =GND= to keep it permanently reset.

| UART Device | Arduino Board |
|-------------+---------------|
| TX          | RX (pin 0)    |
| RX          | TX (pin 1)    |
| GND         | GND           |


The arduinos uses 5V logic. To get 3.3V you need either
- voltage divider (use 1㏀ and 2㏀) ::
  =Arduino TX - [1㏀] - + Device RX + - [2㏀] - GND=
- 1N4148 Diode + Pull-Up (UART only) ::
  Connect a diode (like 1N4148) with cathode to Arduino TX, anode to device RX
  Pull up the RX line on the device to 3.3V with ~10kΩ
- Logic Level Converter Module
