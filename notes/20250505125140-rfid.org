#+HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :summary "RFID reading"


This is about reading and writing RFID. See the notes on [[id:040e6d1b-0d69-445c-bffd-399694cdb58d][wiegand]] for communications between the reader and controller.


* Chips
There are a number of NFC chips with =NXP PN532= the most commonly used. It can only read/write =ISO 14443= and cannot emulate UID (the first byte of the UID is hardcoded to =0x08=, thus trying to set =0x11223344= will result in =0x08223344=).

If we only want to read/write e.g. Mifare Classic =PN532= is a good choice due to the available libraries for Arduino/Rasperry/libNFC

For full emulation a Proxmark3 Easy seems to be the best solution.

  On a related note, newer phones with multiple cameras uses a lidar to determine the distance to an object and thus determine if the "short"- or "long" distance lens should be used. These lidar patterns can be seen with a IR camera and used to e.g. determine if someone is trying to take a photo of you, see [[https://youtu.be/R5nMqju6crY?t=2239][Optical Espionage: Using Lasers to Hear Keystrokes Through Glass Windows - samy kamkar]]
