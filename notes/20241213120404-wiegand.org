#+HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :summary "notes about Wiegand protocol inception between card reader and controller"


Wiegand (pronounced wee-gand) is a standardized interface protocol commonly utilized to communicate data between a simple reader and access controller

By simple is meant that the reader reads card number or PIN(or other data), and forward it to a control panel without making any access decisions.

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiegand_interface#Physical_layer][Wiegand interface]] uses three wires, one of which is a common ground and two of which are data transmission wires usually called DATA0 and DATA1, alternatively labeled "D0" and "D1" or "Data Low" and "Data High"


* logic analyzers
There are a number of esp-based sniffers(logic analyzers) that can be attached to the wires from the reader. They are transparent to both the card reader and the downstream panel. See the [[https://github.com/rfidtool/ESP-RFID-Tool/tree/master/Connector-Adapter-Options][pictures]] for means of connecting. The punchdown seems easy to use.

They are quite simple, the benefit of buying a module is the small form factor.
** espkey

[[https://www.redteamtools.com/espkey][espkey]], [[https://www.redteamtools.com/content/ESPKey%20Tool%20Manual%20v1.0.0.pdf][manual]] and [[https://github.com/octosavvi/ESPKey][github repo]].

** ESP-RFID-Tool
The [[https://github.com/rfidtool/ESP-RFID-Tool][ESP-RFID-Tool]] is very similar to the [[*espkey]] and can be bought of aliexpress. The is a fork [[https://github.com/Einstein2150/ESP-RFID-Tool-v2/][ESP-RFID-Tool-v2]], but the difference seems minor.
** The Tick, ESP32 C3 based

[[https://github.com/jkramarz/TheTick][The Tick]] is a new implementation of the espkey using a ESP32-C3. It seems to support more than just Wiegand protocol.
** Paxton
Paxton is a access control system

[[https://github.com/00Waz/Paxtogeddon-Reader][Paxtogeddon-Reader]], like the espkey just for Paxton.
[[*The Tick, ESP32 C3 based]] is also able to decode Paxton.

** Long range readers (weaponized readers)
A tool that allows to capture RFID access card credentials from several feet away.
Basically it is an Wiegand based RFID long range reader and a esp-based logic analyser.

There are several ways to make a long range reader
- [[https://github.com/TeamWalrus/tusk][tusk]], an diy esp32 updated version of the original [[https://shubs.io/guide-to-building-the-tastic-rfid-thief/][tastic-RFID-Thief]]
- [[https://github.com/sh0ckSec/RFID-Gooseneck][ESP-RFID-Tool]] version of the above, ie. saves the hassle of programming an ESP32. Just connect the ESP-RFID and power to the reader. Have nice high-quality pictures.
  This can also be fitted into a [[https://github.com/sh0ckSec/ClipboardCloner][Officemate Super Storage Supply Clipboard Case]].
- [[https://web.archive.org/web/20230510003220/https://www.x90x90.net/hardware/2022/11/11/Tastic-RFID-thief.html][RFID reader + espkey]], just another example. It's better to go with the ESP-RFID-Tool, same functionality just cheaper.

The three readers I have seen used are

- HID Maxiprox 5375 (125kHz HID ProxII cards)
- HID Indala ASR-620 (125kHz Indala cards)
- HID iCLASS R90 (13.56mHz iClass cards)

** doorsim
[[https://github.com/evildaemond/doorsim][doorsim]] is a esp32 based access simulator.

* alternatives to the Wiegand protocol.
- Open Supervised Device Protocol, commonly referred to as =OSDP= ::
  - a serial protocol standardized by the SIA that supports bi-directional communications among devices, as well as encryption.
  - disadvantages of OSDP are (1) the use of symmetric key, and not public key, for secure channel communications, and (2) system latency, i.e. slow reader response.
