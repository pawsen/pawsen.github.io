It is relatively easy to convert your bike to an ebike.

The main decision is whether to use a mid- or hubdrive motor.
- The hubdrive is good for flat county. It is much simpler just to change a wheel.
  It is either geared or gearless (Generally, the low-power motor is
  geared and the high-power motor is gearless. The latter has regenerative
  breaking, which can increase the range up till 10%). The geared hub is smaller
  and lighter, climbs hills better but have a lower top speed.

- middrives are good for hills/off road/high quality and seems to be more popular among the geeky segment of DIY ebikes.

* Bafang middrives
** BBS models (BBS02/BBS02B/BBSHD) / only bottom brackets
Get the BBSHD. You will never regret the extra power and torque. Also, its 'Heavy Duty' and not prone to burning out like the '02 if used for steep hill climbing.

Standard current usage
- BBS02: 25A
- BBSHD: 30A, but can be modified to >50A.
*** Bottom Brackets and fits :ATTACH:

The easiest is to print one of the [[https://intercom.help/bafangusadirect/en/articles/4649613-bbs02-bbshd-motor-fitment-templates][fitment templates]] (*REMEMBER to set paper size to US letter when printing this template*)

Else, to see if the BB motor and the frame will need bottom bracket spacers(could be stacked M6 washers), measure the distance from the center of the BB and to the frame chain stay(the rod going backwards towards the rear axle).
The distance should be [[https://www.empoweredcycles.com/blogs/news/101474694-bottom-bracket-standards-and-bafang-mid-drive-motors
][at least]] 7cm (2 2/3"). Move the ruler out to determine the needed spacing. See the picture below.

*** Higher current
There are three ways to increase the current (and thus power)

- [[https://endless-sphere.com/sphere/threads/how-to-50a-bbshd-controller-mod.83778/][Change shunts on stock controller (gives 50A)]]
- Change the controller
- Change the amp settings in the controller firmware

** M series kits (M510/M560/M820)
M620 (Ultra) and other motors (model format "Mxx0") requires bafang proprietary frame mounts.
Model format "Mxx5" are designed for converting bikes to ebikes with a bottom bracket attachment. See https://bafang-e.com/en/products/motors/m-series/.

The M series is an "upgrade" of the BBS series, and has some improvements but also switches to the (currently) non-hackable CANBUS controls. There is also a modest change in the mounting.
(=M620=, =M300=, =M400= are exceptions and use UART communication, not CANbus.)

The M-series conversion kits have seen a bit of thrashing going on. Originally Bafang announced the M625 as the replacement for the BBSHD and the M325 for the BBS02. These new models have since disappeared. They now have the M615 and the M315 models, which appear to be the old models (BBSHD, BBS02) with new nomenclature, and the CANBUS controller instead of the UART one IIRC. There is a new model that is starting to roll out, the M635 (1000W), which adds torque sensing to the system. (The M620 has torque sensing, which I have and do like a lot.) Unless you want torque sensing then the old models will be fine, and if you want to hack the controller they are the way forward.

If you are looking for power over budget then the 1000W Bafangs are hard to beat, and can be modded with even more powerful controllers ($$$$). If you want good power as well as less weight then the 750W BBS02 is a good choice. A comparable conversion kit (to the BBS02) is the 750W Tongsheng TSDZ2, and it adds torque sensing for a smoother experience (available with custom open source firmware). For general use either of the 750W motors will be fine - you will not generally be using all of the power anyway.

If you are into hill climbing then there is never too much power...
** Front chainrings
Some chain rings have alternating wide-narrow teeth. This will grab the chain better.
- Gustavo chainring, 7075 T6 alloy (good, better than 6061). Find it on AliExpress.

The chainring might hit the chainstay on the frame. If so, either use bottom bracket spacers to move the motor, which will leave less thread on the opposite side for the locking nut. If there is too little thread left, use chainring spacers.

If you have a full suspension bike with a 12speed cassette, you need the

Derailment can be a chainline issue. Either get a chain ring with an offset

** displays

The display should be compatible with the battery voltage.
- The =C965= is rated for =24V/36V= and estimates the SoC from the "Open Voltage". Using a 52V battery will show a wrong battery percentage, but motor/controller will still function.
  If possible, get the display to show the actual voltage instead.

The displays below should be good for nominal 52V batteries.

[[https://electricbike-blog.com/bbs02-displays/][I recommend the 500c]] but if you can’t get the 500c the DPC-14 is a good 2nd bet.
The DPC 14 is also called 850c

[[https://manual.eggrider.com/displays/eggrider_v2/overview/][EggRider V2]] is a programming enabled display+app that can change controller settings(using =UART=) on the fly.
** CANbus
As of 2025 the bafang motors seems to be CANbus only. The internals of the motor are the same, so it is possible to replace the CANbus controller with an UART.

It is possible to change some of the CANbus settings using the bafang GO+ app, but that requires a display that both have bluetooth AND is compatible with the bafang app.
As of april 2025, only these displays works with the app.
- DPC080
- DPC010

#+begin_quote
C010 controller and CANBUS setup - you can change a bunch of settings around assist levels, voltage, acceleration, startup angle, etc from with inside the display interface (my settings unlock code was 1919), or connect with the Bafang Go app via Bluetooth and do it from there. Very cool - most will say not as flexible as the old UART setup, but it's been great for me.
#+end_quote

The gear sensor cut-off time is 300ms for =UART= and 500ms for CAN. The CANbus cut-off time can at the moment, 2025, not be changed.

Here are some notes on the [[https://kaspars.net/blog/bafang-canbus][Bafang CANbus]].
* Other middrive motors
** Tongsheng TSDZ2 (Or the newer TSDZ8)
Alternative to the BBS02 700W.
Have torque sensor, instead of cadence like the BBS model, which should give a smoother ride

Is a bit delicate so for tough usage the BBS02 is a better choice, especially for uphill climbing(TSDZ2 seems to overheat).
For normal city usage the TSDZ2 seems to be preferred.
** CYC
High-end motors with toque sensing. Smaller, lighter and higher quality than both Bafang and Tongsheng, but much more expensive.
Ideal for the "true" offroad.

Models include
- 750W photon
- 1500W X1 Stealth
- 5000W X1 Pro

***** How to make a template from a downloaded png :ATTACH:
Find a [[https://lierskogenebikes.no/en/batteries][outline of the case]]([[attachment:DP-2170-7 dims.png][local copy]]) with dimensions. (=367x156mm=)

In GIMP
- crop the image to the case
- measure a known dimension like the length, =tools/measure= (U). The distance is in pixels (=342px=)
- change the X/Y resolution to =342px/367mm = 0.96px/mm= in =Image/print size=
- in =tools/scale image=, note the width of the image (=876mm=). Change the resolution to =300px/in=, set the width to the previous value (=876mm=) and press scale.
- measure the length, set the scale to =mm= to make sure the image has the right dimensions
- add a =10x10mm= grid, =Image/Configure grid= and set spacing to 10mm.
- add a =10x2cm= ruler which can used to check the printed template kept the correct scaling ::
  make a selection box, inset position (=80,60mm=) and size (=100x20mm=).
  draw the ruler, either using the pen tool with 2px width(and snapping to the grid) or use =Filters/pattern/grid=

Export as png and convert to pdf

- 1 point (pt) = 1/72 inch
  So the physical size is:

- Width (in) =1046.9472*14.54 in≈369.3 mm=
- Height (in) =443.87872*6.17 in≈156.8 mm=
(which is what we expected)

** Multiple batteries

Two batteries can be connected to improve the range.
It doesn't matter if they are different capacities but *MUST* be same voltage and state of charge when first connected.
