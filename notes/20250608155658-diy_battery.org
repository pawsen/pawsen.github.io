** 14s
I had some troubles finding a suitable case. I wanted a 52V(14s) battery which for a 14s4p battery is 56 cells. I previously assembled a battery using a [[id:73e43e46-7c36-406f-857a-9c6470ee3891][Polly DP 6]], but that is for 18650 cells and this time I wanted to use 21700 due to the higher capacity.

Initially I thought about [[id:c7277909-5013-4c2a-bdd4-dff9c3ad389d][3d printing a case]] but was unable to find a printer that would fit the whole case and print in ABS.
Then, from [[https://www.reention.com/en/xzdch/yingwuxilie/][reention.com/down-tube/polly]], I knew there should be a ~Polly DP2170-5~ which fits 56 21700 cells. But searching AliExpress I only found ~Polly DP2170-5C~, which includes space for a controller (hence the *C*) and space for 52 cells (13s4p).
After much looking I finally found a [[https://ebikestuff.eu/en/e-bike-battery-case/296-downtube-battery-case-for-56-cells-10s-36v-21700-polly-dp-2170-5-dp-5-5904107772240.html][seller]](55€). I wrote them an email, to be sure it was the non-C version and asked for a discount code. They gave me *CYW8PC1A*.

#+CAPTION: Polly DP2170-5, I spent a long time looking for this case
[[attachment:polly-dp2170-5.png]]

*** Electronic parts
The case came with cell holders(the plastic spacing), charging port([[https://www.reention.com/en/xzdch/yingwuxilie/220.html][the manufacturer]] says 2.1mm, which is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_power_connector#IEC_60130-10][dc barrel 5.5x2.1]]) and charge indicator but nothing else

You need
- 18awg wire for charging.
- 12awg wire for discharging, silicone insulated, should be good for 30A continuous, 60A peak. (14awg is good for 20A)
- XT60 female connector for discharging. Good for 30A cont. 60A peak.
- [[https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004892183305.html][JBD Bluetooth mini BMS 7-14S with on/off SW]], Size:63*52*12mm. The BMS has Bluetooth, which is very convenient. I use [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marchingband.overkillsolar][OverkillSolar]] for checking the state of the battery
- [[https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007083394347.html][Tangspower 58.8V 3A charger]], DC 5.5x2.1 tip (Or [[https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004678064524.html][58.8V 4A]])

Additionally, to assemble the battery you need
- 0.2mm thick pure nickel strip on a roll
- spot welder
- capton tape for electrical insulation
- Fish paper for extra insulation under the bms
- low heat glue for heat gun

3A charging around 58.8V is probably outside specs for a 5.5x2.1 barrel(wiki says up to 5A, but that is probably for quality connectors). This connector is probably the worst of all the connectors we can buy for the charger

*** Cell layout
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e1bbd719-0205-49c1-ae7f-4fd64c373bfe
:END:

The cell layout, how the parallel and serial groups are connected, is important. The seller was unable to provide a layout so knielsen from the local hackerspace helped me make my own.
A good layout ideally has the same number of connections in the series connection. This is the connection that carries the current. The current between the cells in one parallel group should only be due to balancing or if one cell is poorer(lower capacity or higher internal resistance).

#+NAME: fig:knielse_layout
#+CAPTION: The layout. Pink is the negative end; yellow the positive end of a cell. Blue are cells that are connected on one side(the front); green are cells connected on the backside. i.e. green connects 1-2, blue 2->3, ...)
[[attachment:14s4p_knielsen_drawing.jpg]]


This was the most /balanced/ layout we could come up with. Later I wrote the manufacturer([[mailto:sale_08@reention.com][sale_08@reention.com]]) for a cell layout. I got autodesk files(=dwg=) for the cell holders and =pdf= for the cell layout/nickel strips, both for the =-5= and =-5C= version.

**** Comparison of layouts
I recently found a webpage/app called [[https://electronicsworkshawp.com/tools/batteryDesigner3.1.8/batteryDesigner3.1.8.html][batteryDesigner]]. It makes it easier to create cell layouts. I compared knielsen and my layout with the manufactures and a third I found on the batteryDesigner's plugin for sharing designs, [[https://electronicsworkshawp.com/tools/BatteryViewer/BatteryViewer.html][batteryViewer]].

#+end_export

Even though the one on batteryViewer has a higher consistency(I don't know how it's calculated, maybe total number of series connection divided by cells in series), 69% vs 68%, that is misleading.
We want all the groups to have the same number of connections, the one from batteryViewer has 1(13->14) the rest 3 or higher. Ours has 3 or higher.
I terms of balanced connections ours is the best design.

The worst is the manufactures with 1(7->8) and 2(8->9).

Layout files for batteryDesigner, i.e. they can be imported into the app.

*** Assembling
- Using the layout in fig [[fig:knielse_layout]], scaling and mirroring gave templates for both front and back which I printed and cut with a scissor.
- precut lengths of nickel strips with a scissor. I used three lengths
- put cells in cell holders, put connection templates on top
- place strip, spot weld. When doing the other side, shorting cells can be bad. I covered the cells in a tea tower
  Remember to add taps for the balance wires. Some people prefer to solder the wires to the taps before welding to prevent unnecessary heat transfer.
- Wrap the battery in capton tape
- Place the BMS on a piece of fish paper, glue it to the battery.
- Glue temperature sensor(s) to cells
- Cut and solder balance wires to cells
- Check the voltage of each group using the balance wires.
- Solder on/off button to BMS and "battery negative" to BMS
- Solder wires from discharge port to capacity indicator and charge port, glue them in place
- Solder negative wire from BMS and positive from battery to discharge port. Take care to get the length right.
- Check charging, use the app to see the status of the BMS.
- If possible, do a full charge/discharge cycle using a DC load to check the capacity is a expected. Maybe you forgot to weld one of the cells? That will remove 1/4 of the total capacity.

The battery has five pins for connecting to the battery holder(mounted on the bike). I use two pins for negative and three for positive. On the connector part from the holder, a XT60F wrapped in heat shrink and glue, if for connecting to the motor.

*** Mounting on the bike

The battery is supposed to be attached the frame using the screws for water bottles. On one of the bikes the screws and the mounting plate did not fit (a full suspension bike with very limited space for the battery inside the triangle due to the rear suspension)

Instead I took the mounting plate apart - removed the metal part - and cut three holes on each side for pressing a metal strap through. I flattened the strap with a hammer and secured the straps around the bike

* Powerbanks
** 100W bidirectional PD
*** MYZL-YD24-2.3 with builtin BMS
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       162485ee-4a16-43a0-a812-522fa0ad84bd
:END:
[[https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007792926192.html][MYZL-YD24-2.3]]

This is a 100W bidirectional PD module with built-in BMS for 3-5S.

There is not much information online.
- One comment said efficiency is around 70-80 % at high current (probably 20V5A PD) for a 4S configuration.
- Same user said the board is unable to charge correctly after full discharge. It falls into some kind of loop from which the only way out is to unsolder the board from the battery, only then can you charge the entire device from 0% battery level.
- Another user did not trust the builtin battery protection and bought a cheap 4S 20A BMS
- For 100W discharge, only one (usb-c) device can be connected.

The battery configuration, capacity, etc, is set by flipping 10 dip-switches. See the link. After assembly, the module is [[https://energo-shop.com/ru/100w-100w-5s-power-bank-type-c-myzl-yd24-2.3/][activated by connecting]] a charger for 5 seconds.

The important part of the config are (SIC)
- Number of cells in series connection (I guess this is independent of the BMS, maybe for CC-CV and input voltage) ::
  - Switch 6: Turn on (ON) to set the number of batteries in the main board of 5 pieces.
  - Switch 7: Turn on (ON) to set the number of batteries in the main board of 4 pieces.
  - Switch 8: Turn on (ON) to set 3 sections of the batteries in the main board.

  If you need to install 2 sections, leave all three switches 6, 7, 8 at the off state (OFF).
  If it is necessary to establish 6 or 7 sections, switches 6, 7, 8 should be switched off (OFF), and the resistor R27 should be replaced by the corresponding denomination according to the resistance table.
- Number of batteries for the safety board (I guess BMS) ::
  - Switch 9: Turn on (ON) to set the number of batteries in the 3 pieces of safety board.
  - Switch 10: Turn on (ON) to set the number of batteries in a security card of 4 pieces.

  If 5 batteries are needed, both switches 9 and 10 should be switched off (OFF).
  Note: Switches 9 and 10 cannot be included(ON) at the same time!

Additional explanations:
- Switches 6, 7, 8 determine the number of batteries in the main board.
- Switches 9, 10 determine the number of batteries in the safety board.
- If the safety board is not used, switches 9 and 10 can be ignored, as the main board contains built-in protection.

I don't really get the additional explanation about the mainboard having builtin protection.

Resistor ~R24~ sets the capacity of the battery. I don't know why this is needed. I guess the %- remaining capacity is calculated from the open voltage, but maybe not. Anyway, the marking on the resistor on my module is ~14C~, [[https://kiloohm.info/eia96-resistor/14C][13.7]]㏀, corresponding to 10000mAh. There is a formula to calculate the resistance, see the link to aliexpress.

Resistor ~R18~ sets the function of the button.
- Long press: On small current mode
- double press: turn off
- changing the resistor changes the behavior of a single click.

#+CAPTION: Resistor R24 seen on a microscope. Otherwise I couldn't make out the marking

**** testing
BMS switch off
- low cell voltage of 3.3V
- high cell voltage at 4.2V, but cells are not balanced. ::
  - 0-1: 4.11V
  - 1-2: 4.13V
  - 2-3: 4.12V
  - 3-4: 4.23V

Discharge at 100W heats the inductor to ~77℃


*** IP2368 with external BMS
Another option is to get a [[https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003954338954.html][IP2368]] module, also 100W bidirection but without a bms. This is 4S by default but can be changed by changing ~R7~ (2-6S).
- Get a 4S 20A bms
- add a heatsink on the four mosfet
- optioanlly, extend the leds. Ie. wire and 4 small leds, solder to D1-D4.
- optionally, move the two capacitors and inductor on the backside to the side, extending with wires, for flush mount
- [[https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005009420164605.html][AliExpress seller]]
See this [[https://youtu.be/QPQXsRYFZLs&t=514][video]].

I would get this module over the [[id:162485ee-4a16-43a0-a812-522fa0ad84bd][WYZL-YD24-2.3]]

*** Making a case
I found an old lead/acid battery and cut off the top with a hacksaw(around where the top part is welded to the box is good). The lead cells are surrounded by acid-soaked pouches, remove them with a plier, and remove the cell walls with a fine cutter, chisel, flush cutter, dremel or whatever is handy.
