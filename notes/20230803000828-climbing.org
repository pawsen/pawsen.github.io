Andy Kirkpatrick [[https://www.andy-kirkpatrick.com/blog/view/rappel-knots-1][writes]](see the link for more rappel knots)
#+begin_quote
This knot is ideal when you’re unsure about using an OOB(Offset Overhand Bend aka EDK), such as when your ropes are wet, icy or muddy, or when they are radically mismatched in diameters, such as a 10 mm rope and a 6 mm rope.

This is the same as the Gibbs knot, but you only pass one strand back around and through the knot, achieving the same strength effect, but without creating quite as large a knot.

Although less well known, this is perhaps the knot we should all be using, as it works better when dealing with miss-matched ropes and is also more forgiving, all for one extra loop around.

Do the extra turn with the thinner rope (blue strand in the next image)

** double looped knots
- [[https://www.climbing.com/skills/tech-tip-sport-streamlining-anchors/][Bowline with two loops]](bowline on a bight)
- [[https://www.alpinesavvy.com/blog/double-loop-bowline-for-a-rappel-tether][double loop bowline for rappel extension]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karash_double_loop][karash douple loop]]
  Alternative to the bowline on a bight. According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowline_on_a_bight#Dangers][wikipedia]], the ears of the bowline might slip if only one loop is loaded.

* Tech tips
** anchor :ATTACH:
[[https://youtu.be/jkx02ANJiDY][Ortovox demonstration video]]. The video is nice and shows that the anchor points(hangers) can be threaded directly with cordelette, saving carabiners. And non-locking carabiners can be used.

[[attachment:StandplatzlogikVDBS2020.pdf][Standplatzlogik]] is the german DAV description of making anchors with girth hitch, basically same method as in the Ortovox video.

*** girth hitch
[[https://staff.weber.edu/derekdebruin/][white paper on slip wrt girth hitch]]
*** Slinging block with rope
  walk around the boulder. Take the strands from both sides of the boulder; form a double bight and tie the bowline on a bight.
  Alt: leave more slack on your side and clove hitch your strand to the master point, this makes it possible to maneuver more
  [[attachment:slinging_block_rope_anchor.jpg]]
** rappelling
*** Passing a knot
1. prussik or kleimhest above the device ... attached to your belay loop by a munter mule
2. keep the prussik unweighted and rap down to your knot
3. weigh the prussik, make sure you have enough room to take off the ATC from the rope
4. pull up some slack after the knot, tie a fig 8 and clip it to your belay loop ... this is your safety should anything happen
5. take off your ATC and put it back on after the knot
6. keeping a firm hand of on the brake, simply release the munter mule ... if everything screws up youre still clipped into the 8
7. take off the fig 8 and rap down normally
the key is using the munter mule on the prussic ... if at any time it seizes, you can easily release it ...


Another method, if you know the knot is there
1. pull the joined rap lines up until you get to the knot and put your ATC device on the rope just below the knot. Tie off the device releasably and clip it to the harness belay loop.
2. Girth-hitch a sling to the harness tie-in points and set up a Munter hitch rappel with the rappel biner at about head level. Rappel using the Munter hitch until your weight is fully supported by the tied-off ATC. (Practice this part somewhere mellow to make sure the Munter sling is in fact long enough to allow your weight to come onto the tied-off ATC.)
3. Now comes the trick: even though the Munter is still loaded, you can open the gate and pop it off the rope (try it in the same mellow place). Release the ATC tie-off and continue the rappel.
- Note 1: You might find that the Munter twists the rope and starts to create a clusterf#ck near the knot and ATC. In this case, stop descending, unclip the ATC and undo the twists, reclip the ATC and continue down. If you are going to do this, make sure to do it before you get too close to the knot.
- Note 2: For extra safety, use a figure-8 or butterfly loop backup tied in the rope below the ATC and clipped to the harness.
- Note 3: You can still use an autoblock on the belay loop, but you'll have to remove it when you get to the rope-joining knot and re-install it underneath the knot.

** Prucell prusik :ATTACH:

#+CAPTION: Purcell prusik
[[attachment:purcell_prusik.jpeg]]

Tied in the usual way, it consists of a prusik hitch sort of tied back onto itself to make an double strand adjustable loop. This has a few applications in self rescue, rope ascending, rigging mechanical advantage systems, adjusting rescue litters, and impressing your knot-nerd pals. One useful feature is that it can be extended under load, which makes it handy for knot passing and other rescue-type stuff. Plus, it’s inexpensive.

[[https://www.alpinesavvy.com/blog/single-strand-purcell-prusik][alpinesavvy]] links to a [[https://youtu.be/rGqorj3q0_U][video]] showing how to tie a prucell prusik as a single strand.([[http://www.bluugnome.com/shareables/purcell-prusik/purcell-prusik-tether.aspx][Here's]] a deep dive into prucell prusik, but it's not really worth the time to read.).
The prucell is nice to know, but not super important

Brent Barhahns sells a modifies version he calls [[https://avantclimbing.com/products/soft-cinch-lead-rope-solo-backfeed-preventer-5-pack][soft-cinch]]. The main difference is a /hammerhead/ keeping the rope in place, which should be a "game changer"

** p-led
p-led is called quick-links or mailon, [[https://www.google.com/search?q=delta+link+climbing][here]] shown as triangular shape (delta link)

** cord size

| size | strength |
|------+----------|
| 5mm  | 5.5kN    |
| 6mm  | 7.5kN    |
| 7mm  | 13kN     |
Note that the 7mm cord is over 40% stronger than the 6mm, and almost 60% stronger than 5mm.

*** Cordelette for rock climbing, anchors
6-7m of 7mm cord
*** For prusik
1m of 5-6 mm
*** abalakov thread / v thread
1-2 m of ≥7mm cord. The 7mm comes not from strength but surface area.
Use the ice screw to measure distance between holes, to create 60° triangle. [[https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/Rappelling-on-an-abalakov?ActivityName=Ice-climbing][petzl instruction.]]

btw [[https://www.google.com/search?q=Grivel+Candela+Ice+Screw+Tool][Grivel Candela Tool]] for hooking the cord.

*** Petzl connect adjust
≥8mm (dynamic) cord. See [[https://youtu.be/ZZuDTKIDptc?feature=shared&t=86][this]] for example of two CA's on a single 8mm cord, girth hitch to harness with knot. Figure of 8 knot at each end, allows to clip the knot into the CA carabiner to create a loop.

** breaking strength of climbing rope (approx 13kN)
[[https://youtu.be/ZWaDh6-roMI?feature=shared&t=303][This]] test shows that a dynamic climbing rope breaks around 12kN in a drop test and 13-14kN in a slow pull test. Ie. the rope breaks around the same, whether it's a drop- or slow pull test.
** force on gear/climber when falling on dynamic rope (less than 6kN)

From [[https://www.hownot2.com/post/climbing-science#c990e4_9baafdd0e10848cfbc376951dfcde834~mv2.png][hownot2]]
| anchor | climber | belayer |
|--------+---------+---------|
|      4 |     2.5 |       1 |

But having a ground anchor increases the forces. See this [[https://www.hownot2.com/post/big-climbers#viewer-djhjt][chart]]

* accidents
** carabiner broke by cross-loading from Grigri
[[http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/13200305300/Fall-on-Rock-Inadequate-Protection-Inadequate-Clothing-and-Equipment-Weather][incident]] and [[http://www.rockclimbing.com/cgi-bin/forum/gforum.cgi?do=post_view_flat;post=168185;page=1;sb=post_latest_reply;so=ASC;mh=25;][discussion]]
lesson: use carabiner which prevents the grigri from rotating in the bin.
** Using ascenders as belay devise
