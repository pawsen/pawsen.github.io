Tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) are becoming common on automobiles,
and in certain countries, are required as a condition of sale. Most TPMS
devices use simple wireless communication techniques such as:

- FSK modulation
- Manchester bit coding
- Small CRCs or checksums
- Unique device identifiers
