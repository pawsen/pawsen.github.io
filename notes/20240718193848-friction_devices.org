** Theoretical :ATTACH:
The theoretical efficiency can be estimated using the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capstan_equation][capstan equation]] (belt friction equation)

T_2 = T_1 \exp^{\mu \beta}

#+attr_html: :width 50% :height 50%
#+CAPTION: Capstan equation for belt friction
[[attachment:capstan_equation.png]]

Using this simple friction law leads us to conclude that the frictional forces for a rope depends only on three things:
- the tension in the rope
- the coefficient of friction
- the total angle of contact

#+CAPTION: 11.1mm Sterling HTP rope, 90 degree bend over 60mm polished Aluminium tube, 75kg test mass: raise, rest, then lower.
[[attachment:capstan_measured_friction.png]]

- Once the tension reaches 90kgf, the mass leaves the ground.
- After a short time, hauling stops and the mass is left to rest with a holding tension around 80kgf.
- This sequence is repeated two more times with small spikes up to 96kgf ‚Äì these show the slightly larger effort required to overcome static friction.
- The tension required to maintain upward movement is about 92kgf.
- After a rest, the system is set to lower and the mass is lowered to the ground in one sequence with a lowering tension of about 53kgf.
- The angle(Œ≤) through which contact occurs is 90 degrees, or œÄ/2 radians

The friction is calculated as


\begin{align}
\mu &= \frac{\ln \frac{T_{raise}}{T_{lower}} }{2 \beta} \iff \\
\mu &= \frac{\ln \frac{92 kgf}{53 kgf} }{2 \frac{\pi}{2} } = 0.175
\end{align}

|-------+--------------------------------+------------------------------+-----------------------------------|

We will get almost a 100-fold saving in effort when lowering if we take 4 round turns around an aluminium bar ‚Äì which is probably where the ‚Äú4-turn‚Äù rule-of-thumb for the tensionless hitch comes from

* Mechanical advantage :ATTACH:

Notes from https://www.ropelab.com.au/pulley-system-analysis/

** Z-rig / 3:1
The mechanical advantage for a 3:1(Z-rig)

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
#+CAPTION: 3:1(or Z-rig) with forces in yellow
[[attachment:z-rig-forces.jpg]]

The force on the free end of the rope is ~1~, after pulley P2 with efficiency ~P2~ the force is ~1*P2=P2~ and after pulley ~P1~ the force is ~P1P2~. The force acting on the block is the sum of all forces, ~1+P2+P1P2~.

The MA for a Z-rig in two different configurations
1. P1 is a pulley ~P1=90%~, P2 is a carabiner ~P2=50%~
2. P1 is a carabiner ~P1=50%~, P2 is a pulley ~P2=90%~


|    | 1 |  P1 | P2  | P1P2 |   MA |
|    | x |     | x   | x    |      |
|----+---+-----+-----+------+------|
| 1. | 1 | 0.9 | 0.5 | 0.45 | 1.95 |
| 2. | 1 | 0.5 | 0.9 | 0.45 | 2.35 |
(*x* indicates the term is used for calculating MA)

Since ~P1~ only appears in higher order terms, the MA is higher when ~P2~ has the highest efficiency. A general rule of thumb seems to be
#+begin_quote
the best pulley closest to hand 
#+end_quote

** Generalization
As a premise, the number of terms in the calculation of MA for any pulley system follows
#+begin_quote
Each term, a product of combination of pulley efficiencies, appears at maximum once in a calculated MA (1). Further, each pulley‚Äôs efficiency may appear at maximum once in each term (2).
#+end_quote

ie, number of terms are $2^N$ where $N$ is the number of pulleys

#+CAPTION: Four order terms in any 4-pulley system. The terms to include in MA have to be determined based on the actual setup/free body diagram
[[attachment:4pulley_combinations.png]]

The first row shows how the terms contribute to the MA, assuming all pulley efficiencies as 80%.
