General usage, good for brush up
https://noelwelsh.com/posts/doom-emacs/
* registers (")
example: store abc in register =a= by =yiw= (yank inner word).
- type abc
- copy to register ="ayiw=

- copy from register ="ap= (normal mode) or =C-r a= in insert mode

see content of all registers with =:reg=. [[https://www.brianstorti.com/vim-registers/][primer on registers]]
* mark position (')
- mark position to A, =mA=
- goto position, ='A=
* moving to text

| Keybind  | Description                                                 |
|----------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| =s/S=    | Snipe move to matching text, cycle matches with =, / ;=     |
| =gs SPC= | Avy move to matching text                                   |
| =ys z/Z= | yank sourround with snipe                                   |
| =ys x/X= | yank sourround with snipe; exclude letters from word-object |

These movements can also be used for creating text objects, ie marking with =vs
CHARS= or =vg SPC CHARS=. For yank, =ys= is bound to ~evil sourround~, thus the
alternative keybinding of =z/Z= or =x/X=

** evil surround
=yse f= insert surround function
=yse t= insert surround tag
=cs'"= change ' with "
=ds'= delete '

=yse b= insert ()
=yse B= insert {}

phonetics:
=y= yank or insert
=d= delete
=c= change

The letters =w=, =W=, and =s= correspond to a |word|, a |WORD|, and
a |sentence|, respectively. These are special in that they have nothing to
delete, and used with |ds| they are a no-op. With |cs|, one could consider them
a slight shortcut for =ysi= (cswb == =ysiwb=, more or less).

A =p= represents a |paragraph|. This similarly to w, W, and s above; however,
newlines are sometimes added and/or removed.

The target(what comes after eg. *ys*) takes a wim motion or text object. The
difference is that motion, e.g., =cw=, operates from the current cursor
position. A command using a text-object, e.g., =ciw= operates on the whole
object regardless of the cursor position.

There are two text objects(=a= and =i=), for the three building blocks of
plaintext: words, sentences and paragraphs.
=aw= around word
=iw= inner word

=f= forward to char
=F= backward
=t= till before char
=T= backwards untill

Use =,= and =;= to jump to the previous and next occurrence of the character
found with t, T, f, or F.

evil-indent-plus
- =ii= A block of text with the same or higher indentation.
- =ik= A block of text with the same or higher indentation, including the first
  line above with less indentation.
- =ij= A block of text with the same or higher indentation, including the first
  line above and below with less indentation.

See [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-surround/blob/master/evil-surround.el#L52-L67][code]] and detailed [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround/blob/master/doc/surround.txt][examples]].

* narrowing / multiple cursors

Narrow also works on text objetcs

* org

| keybind           | Description                                                       |
|-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =[[*=  C-SPC      | Insert internal link to heading (ie. complete after typing =[[*=) |
| =[[*]]=  C-SPC    | Insert link to roam (ie complete after typing =[[*]]=)            |
| SPC n l / C-c C-l | Copy link id / Insert link id                                     |
|                   |                                                                   |

** babel
=C-c C-v d=, insert org src-blocks. If it is invoked within a code block will split it into two separate code blocks, and if it is invoked outside a code block will surround the current selection with a new code block
=C-c C-,=, insert environment defined in =org-structure-template-alist=
https://stackoverflow.com/a/54330547

These are the languages org can evaluate.
[[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html][babel laungages]] shows 'out-of-the-box' enabled languages.

See currently enabled languages with =C-h v= =org-babel-load-language=

** highlight code blocks
org-mode just appends =-mode= to the language name given and tries to find a major mode function.
Emacs lisp function names are case sensitive.

We can get a list of all such functions by typing =C-h a= =-mode$=, i.e. search
for all functions that end with -mode, but the resulting list contains many
modes that are not major modes for programming languages.

For more complicated mappings, org uses the alias mapping, (key, value), in =org-src-lang-modes=. See them with =C-h v=.

** completion
company:

By default, completion is triggered after a short idle period or with the
=C-SPC= key. While the popup is visible, the following keys are available:

| Keybind | Description                              |
|---------+------------------------------------------|
| =C-n=   | Go to next candidate                     |
| =C-p=   | Go to previous candidate                 |
| =C-j=   | (evil) Go to next candidate              |
| =C-k=   | (evil) Go to previous candidate          |
| =C-h=   | Display documentation (if available)     |
| =C-u=   | Move to previous page of candidates      |
| =C-d=   | Move to next page of candidates          |
| =C-s=   | Filter candidates                        |
| =C-S-s= | Search candidates with helm/ivy          |
| =C-SPC= | Complete common                          |
| =TAB=   | Complete common or select next candidate |
| =S-TAB= | Select previous candidate                |

** Vim-esque omni-completion prefix (C-x)
In the spirit of Vim's omni-completion, the following ~insert mode~ keybinds are
available to evil users to access specific company backends.
| Keybind   | Description                       |
|-----------+-----------------------------------|
| =C-x C-]= | Complete etags                    |
| =C-x C-f= | Complete file path                |
| =C-x C-k= | Complete from dictionary/keyword  |
| =C-x C-l= | Complete full line                |
| =C-x C-o= | Invoke complete-at-point function |
| =C-x C-n= | Complete next symbol at point     |
| =C-x C-p= | Complete previous symbol at point |
| =C-x C-s= | Complete snippet                  |
| =C-x s=   | Complete spelling suggestions     |

Fx, typing =/etc/f=, then pressing =C-x C-f= will complete the path
** list errors

lsp-mode integrates with flycheck or flymake.
(flycheck is used if present, flymake is used as fallback, see the variable lsp-diagnostics-provider and [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/CPP-guide/#diagnostics][lsp-mode tutorial]].)

| keybind     | Description                 |
|-------------+-----------------------------|
| =SPC c X=   | lsp-treemacs-error-list     |
| =SPC c x=   | +default/diagnostic         |
| =C-c ! l=   | flycheck-list-errors        |
| =C-c ! n=   | flycheck-next-error         |
| =C-c ! p=   | flycheck-previous-error     |
| =C-c ! C-w= | flycheck-copy-error-as-kill |

To copy an error to the clipboard for easier searching use either =C-c ! C-w=. Or use the =lsp-treemacs-error-list= / =flycheck-list-errors= and press =Y= at the relevant line.

* searching
These keybindings are available while a search is active:

| Keybind   | Description                                                        |
|-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =C-RET=   | Open the selected candidate in other-window                        |
| =C-SPC=   | Preview the current candidate                                      |
| =C-;=     | Open a buffer with your search results                             |
| ==        | Open a writable buffer of your search results                      |
|-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =C-j/k=   | In buffer(=C-c C-o=): open next/prev result without changing focus |
| =C-o=     | open result without changing focus                                 |
| =g o=     | ~ivy-occur-dispatch~                                               |

* rectangle edit
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Rectangles.html

https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/19
In evil-mode you can use =evil-visual-block= (default binding of =C-v=) to select a rectangle visually.
* marking
M-@ : mark word. Only mark from cursor position and forward
viw : evil mark word

* tips
=gv= visual restore. Reselect the text
=gc= comment
=ea= insert at the end of the word
While ivy search is active, open wgrep buffer =C-c C-e=. Changes are committed
with =C-c C-c= and aborted with =C-c C-k= (=ZZ= or =ZQ= for evil)
=SPC '= resume last ivy session
=M-o= opens hydra when search is active
=C-w= n: evil-window-map
="ayy= This will store the line in register a.
="ap= This will put the contents of register a at the cursor.
* insert mode
- =C-w= evil-delete-backward-word
- C-k evil-insert-digraph( =C-k aa= inserts å)
- C-r evil-paste-from-register.
  ="= and =+= is default register(system clipboard), ie =C-r "= is like =p=.
  See the register with =: reg= or =M-SPC i r= or paste using =councel-yank-pop= (=SPC y p=)
  ="+yy= and ="+p= copies to and from the default register.
  =*= is "mouse selection and middle click" register. They are named quoteplus
  and quotestar.
- C-y evil-copy-from-above. Copy char above
- C-t evil-shift-right-line. Indent
- C-d evil-shift-left-line. Remove indent

* projectile
Make projectile discover your projects

=M-x projectile-discover-projects-in-directory= and then give the path to the
dir containing the projects. Fx =~/code=

Now projects can easily be opened with =SPC p p=

=M-x projectile-invalidate-cache= bound to  =SPC p i=

** See diffs for two commits side-by-side
=M-x magit-toggle-buffer-lock=

See the diffs associated with the two commits in two separate magit-revision
buffers. You can accomplish this by loading up the first diff in the usual way
(e.g. by hitting =RET= or =BACKSPACE= on it in a log view), running =M-x
magit-toggle-buffer-lock= so that the buffer becomes pinned to that particular
view, and then loading up the second diff in the usual way.

Using =RET= the old buffer might be switched, but due to the =buffer-lock= it is
still available in the buffer list.

* insert unicode characters
=quoted-insert= is bound to =C-q= in normal mode and =C-v= in insert mode.

#+begin_quote
The variable =read-quoted-char-radix= specifies the radix for this feature; set
it to 10 or 16 to use decimal or hex instead of octal.

Unicode chars are often described by their hex-code, thus set
(setq read-quoted-char-radix 16)
#+end_quote

eg, =C-v 21d2 RET= in insert mode will put the ⇒ arrow.
Reverse lookup is done by =SPC i u= or =C-x 8 ret=


(the =C-x 8= could have been chosen to remind us that the default input radix is
8 (octal))

=C-x 8= also has many shortcuts for inserting common characters. In this case,
=C-x 8 o= inserts "°". The =C-x 8= keymap is a good place to define own
shortcuts, to insert the characters you use most often.

*** Change input-method
: M-x set-input-method TeX

Then type something like =\alpha= — it will be replaced with the corresponding
Unicode character. You can switch the input method off by typing =C-\=.

You can find all the supported TeX commands with
: M-x describe-input-method
