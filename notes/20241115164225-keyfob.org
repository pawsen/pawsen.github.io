Sequence is from the HF Transmitter, to the Comms / Switch Module under steering Wheel, the to the BSI(body computer). From there to the Engine ECU, doors etc as commanded.

The following is taken from the Locking docs for a 2004 Berlingo:
Use of the remote control necessitates matching with the vehicle.
The coded message sent to the receiver by each remote control is composed of the following codes :
- A fixed code linked to the key
- A rolling code matched with the vehicle’s receiver
- A code corresponding to the action to be performed
- A code corresponding to the condition of charge of the batteries


The transponder (key detector) is just a coil of wire. Should meassure around 20-21Ω in resistance.
