Use [[id:9a61aa06-a5cb-414d-9e32-b837c2d9227b][sdr]] to determine the CTCSS tone from a UHF walkie-talkie recording by looking at a spectogram.

#+hugo: more

tl;dr

- record raw demodulated audio using =rtl_fm=
- convert to =wav= using =sox=
- visualize spectogram using =audicity= and see the frequency of the Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System (CTCSS).

The photo below shows the setup used to record UHF radio from a walkie talkie at 443MHz

This reminded me of the /7 bit/ spectogram in the [[id:9f5994b5-814e-4a44-9b45-4736c67d041d][fe hacker academy audio]]
** intro

In Europe the frequencies are defined in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMR446][PMR446]]. Analogue PMR446 uses 16 FM channels separated by 12.5 kHz, FM modulated(NFM)

| Channel | Frequency (MHz) | Channel Spacing (kHz) | Channel Spacing Known As |
|---------+-----------------+-----------------------+--------------------------|
|       1 |       446.00625 |                  12.5 | Narrow [NFM]             |

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Tone-Coded_Squelch_System][Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System]] (CTCSS) is a low continuous tone transmitted along with the voice(ranging from 67 to 257 Hz). In CTCSS mode, the receiver only unmutes when the signal also carries the correct sub-audible audio tone. All users with different CTCSS tones on the same channel are still transmitting on the identical radio frequency. [[https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/CTCSS#Additional_Images][CTSCC tones]] and further info.

Thus CTCSS is a way to extend the 16 FM channels. Several groups can use the same channel without listening to each other, as long as the CTCSS tones are different(there are 39 commonly used). CTCSS does not prevent interference, just silence it.

** record the walktie talkie talk :ATTACH:

From the [[http://www.csgnetwork.com/antennaedcalc.html][dipole calculater]] a total length of the dipole should be 0.32m for 446 Mhz, mounted vertical. See [[id:13108c4c-f84e-4685-92fe-320b0c13f6a4][the sdr radio/dipole]] section.
The channel 3 audio is recorded with ~rtl_fm~ (which demodulates the signal and save it as ~raw~ audio samples) and converted to ~wav~ with ~sox~.
#+begin_src sh
rtl_fm -f 446.03125M -M fm -s 12k -g 50 -l 70 > channel3.pcm
sox -r 12k -t raw  -es -b 16 -c 1 channel3.pcm channel3.wav
# optionally, check whats in the header
soxi channel3.wav
#+end_src

The CTCSS tone can be seen from a spectogram of the recorded audio, as shown in fig. [[fig:uhf_spectogram]].

#+NAME: fig:uhf_spectogram
#+CAPTION: Spectogram for voice with constant tone CTCSS. The constant tone is seen to be around 77Hz. Plots from Audacity.

(Note =sonic-visualiser= is a little easier to use if you only want to show a spectogram and peak frequencies)

Eyeballing it, the CTCSS tone is =77Hz= or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Tone-Coded_Squelch_System#List_of_tones][subchannel 4]].
