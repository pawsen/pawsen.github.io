#+title: 3d printing

* Increasing model strength
The strength of a model is mostly defined by the number of perimeters (not infill). If you want to have a stronger print, increase the number of perimeters. That said, infill does help with compression resistance.

* Infill stiffness :ATTACH:

- The two stiffest ones are cubic and gyroid, but cubic is stiffer and much faster! Printing the same size of infill takes 50% longer with gyroid
- if you look for filament efficient option, go for adaptive cubic. It’s still quite strong, but very quick and efficient!

From [[https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill-patterns_177130][prusa documentation]]
- The Gyroid is our favorite and one of the best infills. It’s one of the few 3D structures that provide great support in every direction.

*** brief history
The first 3d-printed gun that got media attention was the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberator_(gun)][Liberator]]. With careful sprint settings it has a lifespan of  8–10 shots.

The history of 3d printed guns: [[https://odysee.com/@THOR.THE.GOD:b/history-of-3d-printed-guns-%28re-upload%29:b][part 1]], [[https://youtu.be/XAPM3sX5G_s?feature=shared][part2]] and a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_3D_printed_weapons_and_parts][list of 3D printed guns]].

A well know gun is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGC-9][FGC-9 Mk2]] (FGC: Fuck Gun Control). The creator JStark1809 died of heart related issues shortly after an arrest/search in Germany. He was 28, approx.

** Shrinkage :ATTACH:

On one side measure the distances of the inner sides with a caliper, on the other side measure the distance between the outer sides. Try to measure the distances without the influence of the first few layers to avoid bias due to elephant foot.

You can use the calculator here to calculate the results: https://yaqwsx.github.io/printer-calculator/#/shrinkage

The calculator is intended for resin printers but shrinkage is still shrinkage and the "exposure bleeding" indicates overextrusion, even if negative values appear to mean overextrusion rather than underextrusion.
** TPU
Shore hardness test measures the hardness of elastic materials such as rubber, polymers and elastomers.
A higher Shore value indicates a harder material

- Soft TPU (Shore 85A-88A): Extremely flexible and elastic. Can be stretched up to 700-1000% of its original length. Typically used for printing components that require high flexibility, such as phone cases and watchbands.
- Medium TPU (Shore 90A): Possesses good flexibility and durability. Can be stretched approximately 500% of its original length. Used for drone components, orthotic inserts, sports equipment, etc. This is the most common type of TPU used in 3D printing.
- Hard TPU (Shore 95A): Still flexible but more rigid. Maximum stretch of around 200-300% of original length. Suitable for applications that require a degree of flexibility as well as support, e.g. electronic enclosures, insoles, toys, handles, etc.

95A is the general, cheap TPU.
Keep the filament dry or heat it in the oven.

Print on [[https://youtu.be/Z05HtwNZtJQ][clear office tape]](Kapton tape) or use a glue stick if printing on a smooth or PEI surface. It might also me necessary to modify the Nextruder Idle Lever by printing a new [[https://www.printables.com/model/596608-nextruder-modified-idler-lever][version]]. As per [[https://blog.prusa3d.com/how-to-print-with-flexible-filament_29672/][this blog]], it might also be necessary to

Loosen your idler as much as possible before you start loading the filament/printing. There is a high risk that the filament will tangle around the bondtech if there’s too much pressure on the string.

 You have to print very slowly, typical safe speed is 20mm/s. Generally, a maximum recommended speed for flexible filaments is 30-40mm/s, because you would risk clogging the nozzle if you set the speed too high. In PrusaSlicer we recommend using the „Flexfill 98A or Filatech FilaFlex40“ profile. It has an optimal speed set through the maximum volumetric speed (It is set to 1.5mm3/s, that’s approximately 17mm/s when using 0.2mm layer).

Use retraction for very flexible filaments, to prevent pressure buildup in the extruder.

*** Drying
PETG absorbs more moisture than PLA or ABS filament. I

- Food hydrator, https://amzn.to/3FtLqK4 This one will work any circular one with an adjustable temp should do fine. You will have to cut out the grate between the levels to get the spool to fit.
- CNC Kitchen made a great video on making a dry box from scratch. https://youtu.be/WEFtUKGAd7k I would also recommend drying your filament for 24 hours.
- get a dryer, https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C9RZPMN this is the one I use.
