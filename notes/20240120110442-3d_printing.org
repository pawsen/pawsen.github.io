Notes about 3d printing and links to some designs

* Increasing model strength
The strength of a model is mostly defined by the number of perimeters (not infill). If you want to have a stronger print, increase the number of perimeters. That said, infill does help with compression resistance.

* Infill stiffness :ATTACH:

- The two stiffest ones are cubic and gyroid, but cubic is stiffer and much faster! Printing the same size of infill takes 50% longer with gyroid
- if you look for filament efficient option, go for adaptive cubic. It’s still quite strong, but very quick and efficient!

From [[https://help.prusa3d.com/article/infill-patterns_177130][prusa documentation]]
- The *Gyroid is our favorite and one of the best infills*. It’s one of the few 3D structures that provide great support in every direction.

*** brief history
The first 3d-printed gun that got media attention was the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberator_(gun)][Liberator]]. With careful sprint settings it has a lifespan of  8–10 shots.

The history of 3d printed guns: [[https://odysee.com/@THOR.THE.GOD:b/history-of-3d-printed-guns-%28re-upload%29:b][part 1]], [[https://youtu.be/XAPM3sX5G_s?feature=shared][part2]] and a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_3D_printed_weapons_and_parts][list of 3D printed guns]].

* Filaments
From [[https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php/Filaments][nick black]]

Manufacturers employ additives to change the properties of their filaments, which I don't attempt to address here. Properties may change across different batches of the same filament. These are very rough comparisons based off oral wisdom.

- *Impact strength*: ASA > ABS > PC > PETG > PLA
- *Tensile strength*: PA >> PC >> ASA > ABS/PETG > PLA
- *UV resistance*: ASA > ABS
- *"Chemical" resistance*: PETG > ABS
- *Melting temp*: PC > ASA > PETG > ABS >> PLA
- *Heat resistance*: PC > ASA > ABS > PETG > PLA
- *Printing speed*:
- *Offensiveness (odor, VOCs while printing)*: ABS > ASA, PA, PC
- *Acetone postprocessing*: ASA/ABS only
- *Ease of sanding*: PLA > PETG > ABS/ASA
- *Ease of painting*: PLA > PETG > ABS/ASA
- *Tendency to warp*: PC > ABS/ASA > PLA > PETG
- *Hygroscopicity*: PA/TPU > PC/PETG > ABS/ASA > PLA
- *Filament density*: PETG/PLA > ABS/ASA
- *Hotend temp required*: PC > ABS/ASA > PETG > PLA
- *Cost*: PPS > PA > PC > ASA > ABS/PETG/PLA

When it comes to polyamides (nylons), PA-12 is less susceptible to hydrolysis than PA-6, more flexible, less resistant to high temperatures, and much more expensive. PA-66 is generally more resistant to high temperatures and hydrolysis than PA-6, and slightly more expensive.
** Shrinkage :ATTACH:
Print this file [[attachment:shrinkage+exposure_calibration.stl][shrinkage+exposure_calibration.stl]]

On one side measure the distances of the inner sides with a caliper, on the other side measure the distance between the outer sides. Try to measure the distances without the influence of the first few layers to avoid bias due to elephant foot.

You can use the calculator here to calculate the results: https://yaqwsx.github.io/printer-calculator/#/shrinkage

The calculator is intended for resin printers but shrinkage is still shrinkage and the "exposure bleeding" indicates overextrusion, even if negative values appear to mean overextrusion rather than underextrusion.
** TPU
Shore hardness test measures the hardness of elastic materials such as rubber, polymers and elastomers.
A higher Shore value indicates a harder material

- Soft TPU (Shore 85A-88A): Extremely flexible and elastic. Can be stretched up to 700-1000% of its original length. Typically used for printing components that require high flexibility, such as phone cases and watchbands.
- Medium TPU (Shore 90A): Possesses good flexibility and durability. Can be stretched approximately 500% of its original length. Used for drone components, orthotic inserts, sports equipment, etc. This is the most common type of TPU used in 3D printing.
- Hard TPU (Shore 95A): Still flexible but more rigid. Maximum stretch of around 200-300% of original length. Suitable for applications that require a degree of flexibility as well as support, e.g. electronic enclosures, insoles, toys, handles, etc.

95A is the general, cheap TPU.
Keep the filament dry or heat it in the oven.

Print on [[https://youtu.be/Z05HtwNZtJQ][clear office tape]](Kapton tape) or use a glue stick if printing on a smooth or PEI surface. It might also me necessary to modify the Nextruder Idle Lever by printing a new [[https://www.printables.com/model/596608-nextruder-modified-idler-lever][version]]. As per [[https://blog.prusa3d.com/how-to-print-with-flexible-filament_29672/][this blog]], it might also be necessary to

Loosen your idler as much as possible before you start loading the filament/printing. There is a high risk that the filament will tangle around the bondtech if there’s too much pressure on the string.

 You have to print very slowly, typical safe speed is 20mm/s. Generally, a maximum recommended speed for flexible filaments is 30-40mm/s, because you would risk clogging the nozzle if you set the speed too high. In PrusaSlicer we recommend using the „Flexfill 98A or Filatech FilaFlex40“ profile. It has an optimal speed set through the maximum volumetric speed (It is set to 1.5mm3/s, that’s approximately 17mm/s when using 0.2mm layer).

Use retraction for very flexible filaments, to prevent pressure buildup in the extruder.

** PETG

*** Drying
PETG absorbs more moisture than PLA or ABS filament. I

- Food hydrator, https://amzn.to/3FtLqK4 This one will work any circular one with an adjustable temp should do fine. You will have to cut out the grate between the levels to get the spool to fit.
- CNC Kitchen made a great video on making a dry box from scratch. https://youtu.be/WEFtUKGAd7k I would also recommend drying your filament for 24 hours.
- get a dryer, https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C9RZPMN this is the one I use.
** drying
Very comprehensive description at [[https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/1408][se]], including drying temp.

[[https://www.printables.com/model/39810-improved-all-in-one-temperature-and-bridging-tower][temp tower]]


Rule of thumb: Dry in the oven at same temp as the bed.

| filament | temp ℃ | time |
|----------+---------+------|
| [[https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/vk5nbr/comment/idnb72i/][TPU]]      |      50 | 4-5h |
| PETG     |      65 | 4-5  |
| ABS      |      80 | 4-5  |

*** Worlds best dryer

The [[https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php/A_case_study_in_full-stack_device_development:_the_dankdryer][dankdryer]] is the world's best dryer. At least it is fully [[https://github.com/dankamongmen/dankdryer][open source]]: code, KiCad, openSCAD. Pretty awesome and totally overkill unless you really need engineering matetrials and have a good printer.

** input shaping
#+begin_quote
In control theory, input shaping is an open-loop control technique for reducing vibrations in computer-controlled machines. The method works by creating a command signal that cancels its own vibration. That is, a vibration excited by previous parts of the command signal is cancelled by vibration excited by latter parts of the command. Input shaping is implemented by convolving a sequence of impulses, known as an input shaper, with any arbitrary command. The shaped command that results from the convolution is then used to drive the system. If the impulses in the shaper are chosen correctly, then the shaped command will excite less residual vibration than the unshaped command. The amplitudes and time locations of the impulses are obtained from the system's natural frequencies and damping ratios. Shaping can be made very robust to errors in the system parameters.
